      "english": "At one time, the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthī, at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now, at that time, the nun Khemā, while wandering on tour through the Kosala country, had taken up residence in Toraṇavatthu, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, stopped for a single night at Toraṇavatthu, between Sāketa and Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a certain man, saying, \"Come, good man, find out if there is any such ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom I might visit today.\" \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" replied that man to King Pasenadi of Kosala, and searching throughout Toraṇavatthu, he did not find any such ascetic or brahmin whom King Pasenadi of Kosala might visit. However, that man saw the nun Khemā, who had taken up residence in Toraṇavatthu. Having seen her, he approached King Pasenadi of Kosala; having approached, he said to King Pasenadi of Kosala, \"Your Majesty, there is no such ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom Your Majesty might visit. However, Your Majesty, there is a nun named Khemā, a disciple of that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One. Indeed, such a good report has spread concerning that venerable lady: 'She is wise, skilled, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, and possesses excellent perspicacity.' Your Majesty should visit her.\" Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the nun Khemā; having approached, he paid homage to the nun Khemā and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the nun Khemā, \"Venerable lady, what becomes of the Tathāgata after death?\" \"Great King, this has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathāgata exists after death.'\" \"Then, venerable lady, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?\" \"Great King, this too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death.'\" \"Venerable lady, does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?\" \"Great King, this too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.'\" \"Then, venerable lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?\" \"Great King, this too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'\" \"Venerable lady, when asked if the Tathāgata exists after death, you say: 'Great King, this has not been declared by the Blessed One: The Tathāgata exists after death.'

You should answer as you see fit. What do you think, Great King, do you have any calculator, counter, or reckoner who could count the grains of sand in the Ganges River, saying, 'There are so many individual grains of sand,' or 'So many hundreds of grains of sand,' or 'So many thousands of grains of sand,' or 'So many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand'?\" \"No, venerable lady.\" \"Do you have any calculator, counter, or reckoner who could count the measures of water in the great ocean, saying, 'There are so many measures of water,' or 'So many hundreds of measures of water,' or 'So many thousands of measures of water,' or 'So many hundreds of thousands of measures of water'?\" \"No, venerable lady.\" \"For what reason?\" \"Venerable lady, the ocean is vast, immeasurable, and unfathomable.\" \"Just so, Great King, any form by which one might designate the Tathāgata—that form has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root cut off, rendered like a palm stump, brought to non-existence, and is no longer subject to future arising. Great King, the Tathāgata, being liberated from the designation of form, is deep, immeasurable, and unfathomable, just like the great ocean. It is not appropriate to say that the Tathāgata exists after death, nor is it appropriate to say that the Tathāgata does not exist after death, nor is it appropriate to say that the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death, nor is it appropriate to say that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.\"\n\nThat feeling by which one might describe the Tathāgata—that feeling has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, uprooted, made like a palm-stump, brought to non-existence, no longer subject to future arising.

After some time, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata exist after death?’ ‘That, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata exists after death.”’ ‘But Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?’ ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata does not exist after death.”’ ‘Then Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata both exists and not exists after death?’ ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.”’ ‘But Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata neither exists nor not exists after death?’ ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.”’ When asked, ‘Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata exist after death?’ you declared, ‘That, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata exists after death.”’ When asked, ‘Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?’ you declared, ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata does not exist after death.”’ When asked, ‘Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata both exists and not exists after death?’ you declared, ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.”’ When asked, ‘But Venerable Sir, does the Tathāgata neither exists nor not exists after death?’ you declared, ‘That too, O great king, has not been declared by me: “The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.”’ What then, Venerable Sir, is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One's non-declaration regarding these matters?\n\n‘In that case, O great king, I shall question you in return about this.

It cannot be said that ‘the Tathāgata exists after death,’ nor that ‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death,’ nor that ‘the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,’ nor that ‘the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’\n\nIt is wonderful, Venerable Sir, it is amazing, Venerable Sir!

Seated to one side, venerable sir, those wandering ascetics of other sects said this to me: 'Friend Anurādha, does the Tathāgata, the supreme man, the highest man, one who has attained the highest achievement, declare him in these four ways: \"The Tathāgata exists after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata does not exist after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death\"?' When this was said, venerable sir, I said this to those wandering ascetics of other sects: 'Friend, concerning that Tathāgata, the supreme man, the highest man, one who has attained the highest achievement, the Tathāgata declares him apart from these four positions: \"The Tathāgata exists after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata does not exist after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,\" or \"The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.\"' When this was said, venerable sir, those wandering ascetics of other sects said to me: 'This monk must be newly ordained, having recently gone forth, or else he is an elder who is foolish and inexperienced.' Then, venerable sir, those wandering ascetics of other sects, having disparaged me as newly ordained and as foolish, rose from their seats and departed. It occurred to me, venerable sir, not long after those wandering ascetics of other sects had departed: 'If those wandering ascetics of other sects were to question me further, how should I explain so that I would be speaking in accordance with the Blessed One's words to them, and would not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is untrue, and would explain the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and no fellow recluse or brahmin would have a valid ground for censure?'\"\n\n\"What do you think, Anurādha, is form permanent or impermanent?\" \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" \"But that which is impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?\" \"Suffering, venerable sir.\" \"But that which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, is it fitting to regard that as: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Is feeling permanent or impermanent? ... Is perception permanent or impermanent? ... Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent? ... Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?\" \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" \"But that which is impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?\" \"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\nBut for that which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, is it appropriate to regard it thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Therefore, Anurādha, whatever form there is—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—all such form should be seen as it truly is with right wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever feeling there is—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—all such feeling should be seen as it truly is with right wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever perception there is—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—all such perception should be seen as it truly is with right wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever mental formations there are—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—all such mental formations should be seen as it truly is with right wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever consciousness there is—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—all such consciousness should be seen as it truly is with right wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus, Anurādha, the well-instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form, becomes disenchanted with feeling, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with mental formations, and becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is liberated; in liberation, the knowledge arises: ‘I am liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no further state of being beyond this.’\n\n“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as form?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as feeling?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as perception?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as mental formations?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as consciousness?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in feeling? Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from feeling? Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in perception? Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from perception? Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in mental formations? Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from mental formations? Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in consciousness?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from consciousness?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness as the Tathāgata?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard this formless, feelingless, perceptionless, formationless, consciousnessless entity as the Tathāgata?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“And Anurādha, since the Tathāgata is not found as a truth or reality even in this very life, is it appropriate for you to make the declaration that the Tathāgata, the supreme person, the ultimate person, who has attained the ultimate attainment, declares apart from these four positions: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death,’ or ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’?”\n“No, Venerable Sir.”\n“Good, good, Anurādha! Formerly, Anurādha, and now also, I declare only suffering and the cessation of suffering.”",

      "english": "Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached Venerable Mahāmoggallāna. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with Venerable Mahāmoggallāna. After exchanging greetings and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “Is the world eternal, Venerable Moggallāna?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The world is eternal.’” “Then, Venerable Moggallāna, is the world not eternal?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The world is not eternal.’” “Is the world finite, Venerable Moggallāna?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The world is finite.’” “Then, Venerable Moggallāna, is the world infinite?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The world is infinite.’” “Is the soul identical with the body, Venerable Moggallāna?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The soul is identical with the body.’” “Then, Venerable Moggallāna, is the soul one thing and the body another?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’” “Does a Tathāgata exist after death, Venerable Moggallāna?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘A Tathāgata exists after death.’” “Then, Venerable Moggallāna, does a Tathāgata not exist after death?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death.’” “Does a Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death, Venerable Moggallāna?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.’” “Then, Venerable Moggallāna, does a Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”\n\n“What, then, Venerable Moggallāna, is the cause, what is the reason, why other sectarian wanderers, when asked thus, make such declarations as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’ or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’ or ‘The soul is identical with the body’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body is another’ or ‘A Tathāgata exists after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’? What, then, Venerable Moggallāna, is the cause, what is the reason, why, when the ascetic Gotama is asked thus, he does not make such declarations as: ‘The world is eternal’ nor ‘The world is not eternal’ nor ‘The world is finite’ nor ‘The world is infinite’ nor ‘The soul is identical with the body’ nor ‘The soul is one thing and the body is another’ nor ‘A Tathāgata exists after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’?” “Other sectarian wanderers, Vaccha, regard the eye as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ They regard the tongue as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ They regard the mind as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That is why, when other sectarian wanderers are asked thus, they make such declarations as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’ or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’ or ‘The soul is identical with the body’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body is another’ or ‘A Tathāgata exists after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ But the Tathāgata, Vaccha, the Arahant, the Fully Awakened One, regards the eye as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ He regards the tongue as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ He regards the mind as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That is why, when the Tathāgata is asked thus, he does not make such declarations as: ‘The world is eternal’ nor ‘The world is not eternal’ nor ‘The world is finite’ nor ‘The world is infinite’ nor ‘The soul is identical with the body’ nor ‘The soul is one thing and the body is another’ nor ‘A Tathāgata exists after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ nor ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”\n\nThen the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After exchanging greetings and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One, “Is the world eternal, Master Gotama?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The world is eternal.’” “Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The world is not eternal.’” “Is the world finite, Master Gotama?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The world is finite.’” “Then, Master Gotama, is the world infinite?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The world is infinite.’” “Is the soul identical with the body, Master Gotama?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The soul is identical with the body.’” “Then, Master Gotama, is the soul one thing and the body another?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’” “Does a Tathāgata exist after death, Master Gotama?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘A Tathāgata exists after death.’” “Then, Master Gotama, does a Tathāgata not exist after death?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death.’” “Does a Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death, Master Gotama?” “This, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.’” “Then, Master Gotama, does a Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?” “This too, Vaccha, has been left undeclared by me: ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’” “What, then, Master Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why other sectarian wanderers, when asked thus, make such declarations as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’ or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’ or ‘The soul is identical with the body’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body is another’ or ‘A Tathāgata exists after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ or ‘A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’?”\n\nWhat then, Venerable Gotama, is the reason, what is the condition, by which, when Venerable Gotama is thus questioned, there is no such declaration as 'the world is eternal,' or 'the world is not eternal,' or 'the world is finite,' or 'the world is infinite,' or 'the life-principle and the body are the same,' or 'the life-principle is one thing, the body another,' or 'the Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'the Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'?\n\nVaccha, other ascetics and wanderers perceive the eye thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' They perceive the ear thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' They perceive the nose thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' They perceive the tongue thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' They perceive the body thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' They perceive the mind thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.' Therefore, when other ascetics and wanderers are questioned in this way, they make declarations such as 'the world is eternal,' or 'the world is not eternal,' or 'the world is finite,' or 'the world is infinite,' or 'the life-principle and the body are the same,' or 'the life-principle is one thing, the body another,' or 'the Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'the Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'\n\nHowever, Vaccha, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Awakened One, perceives the eye thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He perceives the ear thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He perceives the nose thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He perceives the tongue thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He perceives the body thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He perceives the mind thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Therefore, when the Tathāgata is questioned in this way, there is no such declaration as: 'the world is eternal,' or 'the world is not eternal,' or 'the world is finite,' or 'the world is infinite,' or 'the life-principle and the body are the same,' or 'the life-principle is one thing, the body another,' or 'the Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'the Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'\n\nAmazing, Venerable Gotama! Marvelous, Venerable Gotama! How truly wonderful it is that the meaning and phrasing of the Teacher and the disciple harmonize, concur, and do not contradict, especially concerning such a profound doctrine! Just now, Venerable Gotama, I approached the ascetic Mahāmoggallāna and asked him about this very matter.

Ananda, if, when asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there a self?’ I had declared, ‘There is a self,’ would that have been conducive for me, Ananda, to the arising of knowledge, that all phenomena are non-self?” “Certainly not, Venerable Sir.” “And Ananda, if, when asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there no self?’ I had declared, ‘There is no self,’ it would have caused greater confusion for the already confused wanderer Vacchagotta, making him think, ‘Indeed, I certainly had a self previously, but now it no longer exists.’”",

      "english": "At one time, the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana was dwelling among the Ñātikas in the Giñjakāvasatha.\n\nThen the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana. After concluding the courteous and memorable talk, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana: “Indeed, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata exist after death?”\n\n“Vaccha, this has been undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The Tathagata exists after death.’”\n\n“Then, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata not exist after death?”\n\n“Vaccha, this too has been undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The Tathagata does not exist after death.’”\n\n“Indeed, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?”\n\n“Vaccha, this has been undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.’”\n\n“Then, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?”\n\n“Vaccha, this too has been undeclared by the Blessed One: ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor not exists after death.’”\n\n“‘Indeed, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata exist after death?’ When asked this, you say: ‘Vaccha, this has been undeclared by the Blessed One: The Tathagata exists after death.’ ‘Then, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata not exist after death?’ When asked this, you say: ‘Vaccha, this has been undeclared by the Blessed One: The Tathagata does not exist after death.’ ‘Indeed, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?’ When asked this, you say: ‘Vaccha, this has been undeclared by the Blessed One: The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.’ ‘Then, good Kaccana, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?’ When asked this, you say: ‘Vaccha, this too has been undeclared by the Blessed One: The Tathagata neither exists nor not exists after death.’ What, good Kaccana, is the reason, what is the cause, for this to have been undeclared by the recluse Gotama?”\n\n“Vaccha, whatever cause and whatever condition there is for defining one as ‘having form,’ or ‘formless,’ or ‘percipient,’ or ‘non-percipient,’ or ‘neither percipient nor non-percipient’—that cause and that condition would completely, in every way, without remainder, cease. By what then, could one define him as ‘having form,’ or ‘formless,’ or ‘percipient,’ or ‘non-percipient,’ or ‘neither percipient nor non-percipient’?”\n\n“For how long have you been ordained, good Kaccana?”\n\n“Not long, friend, three years.”\n\n“Friend, for one who has been ordained for such a short time, this much is already a great deal; how much more for one who is far advanced!”",
